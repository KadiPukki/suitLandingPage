### The project

This is a perfect landing page! I built the project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The layout is based on a challenge found on the Frontend Mentor website.
The layout was ready, so I had to create the code, respecting the layout and also implementing features such as the pop-up that opens for the user to register an e-mail.
To create this modal, I used JavaScript.
